CSC 4350 – Computer
Networks
Fall 2024 Semester
Lecture 1 – August 22, 2024
Course Introduction
Agenda
• Syllabus and policies
• Start Ch. 1…
Note
• Material used in this lecture is heavily borrowed from Kurose & Ross’
“Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach, 8th Edition”
• Also: assuming no prior knowledge of networks
What Is The Internet?
• Hardware/Software Discussion
• Networking Infrastructure for Services and Distributed Applications
Figure 1.1 – Some Pieces of the
Internet
Nuts and Bolts/Hardware and
Software
• Internet – computer network that connects many computing devices
throughout the world
• Used to be desktop machines, primarily
• With advent of smartphones, tablets, etc. – more ways to connect
• More traditional “non-Internet things” are being connected to the
internet
• Gaming consoles
• Glasses
• Cars
• Watches
• All of these devices are called hosts or end systems
• 18 billion devices connected in 2017; 28.5 billion in 2022?
Hardware and Software
• End systems are connected via communication links and packet switches
• Many different types of communication links from many different media
• Transmission rate of a link is measured in bits/second; different types of links can
transmit data at different rates
• Packets – resulting packages of information are sent through the network to the
destination end system
• Data is then reassembled when received
• Packet switches – takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication
links and forwards that package on one of its outgoing communication links
• Routers
• Link-layer switches
Packet Switches
• Both types of switches forward packets toward their ultimate
destinations
• Link-layer – used in access networks
• Router – network core
• Route/path – sequence of communication links and packet switches
traversed by a packet from sender to receiver
